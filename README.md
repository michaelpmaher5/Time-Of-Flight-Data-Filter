# Time-Of-Flight-Data-Filter
This repository contains MATLAB files that takes data from a Time of Flight camera and removes reading errors. The data is used to model a drag sail that the camera observes. Position, velocity, and acceleration models are all created. Reading errors are removed via implementation of a Kalman Filter. 
The top level executable file is "analyze.m"
